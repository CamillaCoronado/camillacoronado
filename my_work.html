						<p class= "summary">My work at the College of Fine Arts consisted of fulfilling web requests that were recieved through the portal and maintaining 15+ websites. The work I did there was mostly internal. I utilized the SSL certificates to serve our websites over https, I automated the web portion of the monthly dashboard that we sent out to each individual department, and I made a proposal for a Disk Reduction Project in order to decrease load times as well as oversaw the beginning implementation. I also created a plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript page for the Music Livestream as well as monthly landing pages for events.</p>
